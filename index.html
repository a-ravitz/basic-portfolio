                <p>In 2005, at the age of 18, I moved to Philadelphia to study music at University of The Arts. During my time in school, and since, I've have had the opportunity to play hundred's of shows in Philly, and in many great bands on dates with groups like War On Drugs, Kurt Vile, and Sixto "Sugarman" Rodrigues, but my biggest accomplishment has been touring with the Glenn Miller Orchestra.<p>
                <br>
                <p>When I stopped touring with the Glenn Miller Orchestra in 2011, I began working in bars. I've had every job imaginable, from barbacking and cleaning up puke at the South Philadelphia Tap Room, to managing the team, creating drinks, and bartending along side some of the city's best bartenders at Franklin Mortgage and Investment, Co. In 2016 I took another step deeper into the liquor industry by becoming a brand ambassador for Louisville Distilling, Co., representing Angel's Envy Bourbon. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Now, when i'm not working, playing bass, cooking, or riding my bike, i'm trying my hardest to wrap my head around coding for my PennLPS/Trilogy fullstack web development bootcamp classes!</p>
