                <p>In 2005 I moved to Philadelphia to study music at University of The Arts. During my time in school, and since, I've have had the opportunity to play hundred's of shows in Philly, and in many great bands, but my most note worthy musical accomplishment has been touring with one of my grandpa's favorite bands, the Glenn Miller Orchestra.<p>
                <br>
                <p>When I stopped touring with the GMO in 2011, I began working in bars. I've had every job imaginable, from barbacking and cleaning up puke at SPTR, to managing the team, creating drinks, and bartending along side some of the city's best bartenders at Franklin Mortgage and Investment, Co. In 2016 I took another step deeper into the booze business by becoming a brand ambassador for Louisville Distilling, Co., representing Angel's Envy Bourbon. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Now, when i'm not working, playing bass, cooking, or riding my bike, i'm trying my hardest to wrap my head around coding for my PennLPS/Trilogy fullstack web development bootcamp classes!</p>
