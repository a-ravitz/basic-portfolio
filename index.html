                <p>In 2005, at the age of 18, I moved to Philadelphia to study music at University of The Arts. During my time in school, and since, I've have had the opportunity to play hundred's of shows in Philly, and in many great bands on dates with groups like War On Drugs, Kurt Vile, and Sixto "Sugarman" Rodrigues, but my biggest accomplishment has been touring with the Glenn Miller Orchestra.<p>
                <br>
                <p>When I stopped touring with the Glenn Miller Orchestra in 2011, I began working in bars. I've had every job imaginable, from barbacking and cleaning up puke at the South Philadelphia Tap Room to creating menus along side some of the city's finest bartenders as head bartender of Franklin Mortgage and Investment, Co. In 2016 I took another step deeper into the liquor industry by becoming a brand ambassador for Louisville Distilling, Co. representing Angel's Envy Bourbon. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Now, almost fifteen years since I moved to Philly to study bass at UArts, I've decided to go back to school and try something new. </p>
